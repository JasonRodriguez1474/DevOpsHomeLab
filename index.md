# Welcome to the DevOps Homelab Setup Guide

For starters, a homelab is a 'playground' for IT professionals, developers, and just about anyone to grow their technical skills in a non production environment. My primary background is that of a DevOps engineer, with a heavy emphasis on the Operations side of things.

Why should you build out a homelab?
Because it's fun!
No?
Because it is going to hone your skills and make you more competitive in today's market. Always remember, your competition is people like me, and **I don't lose**. You don't have to learn everything that's covered in this guide, or everything covered in the [incredible roadmap found here](https://roadmap.sh/devops). However, even a little bit of additional training goes a long way! 

## Cloud

The 'cloud' is one of the biggest buzzwords in tech at the moment and you would do well to dip your toes into it! Luckily, this is one of the easiest and cheapest things to learn at the moment thanks to how heavily some companies are pushing their cloud infrastructures.

### AWS

I know I'm listing this first, but it actually isn't my favorite cloud provider for beginners anymore. However, they are undoubtedly the market leaders at the moment, so their certifications are king in the space. 

Luckily, they provide 100% free training for their entry level certification 'AWS Cloud Practitioner'. The training can be [found here](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials), and it's estimated to only take around 6hrs to complete and prepare for the exam. Once you've knocked that out, it will also earn you a 50% off voucher for any AWS certification exam you take after that!

For actually training your skills, [these are all the services you can deploy for free within AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). However, I personally find their offerings rather weak as at most you're getting 1 reliably free VM for playing around. 

### Oracle Cloud

Last I checked, they don't even hold 5% of the overall Cloud Market share, and that's exactly why they're perfect for homelabs! You get around 6x the compute with the [Oracle Cloud Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) than you would with AWS. For your first 30 days, you also get $300 in free credits to explore services that aren't covered in the free tier and this could be your chance to learn your way around Kubernetes at no cost to you!

They've also got a bunch of [free learning resources that can checked out here](https://education.oracle.com/learning-explorer#startLearning). However, I'm not entirely sure how strong their certifications are in the market at this time. You'll come to realize soon though, that despite naming their services a little bit differently than AWS, the core concept behind the both is the same, and so they'll both benefit you greatly.
