## Welcome to the DevOps Homelab Setup Guide

For starters, a homelab is a 'playground' for IT professionals, developers, and just about anyone to grow their technical skills in a non production environment. My primary background is that of a DevOps engineer, with a heavy emphasis on the Operations side of things.

Why should you build out a homelab?
Because it's fun!
No?
Because it is going to hone your skills and make you more competitive in today's market. Always remember, your competition is people like me, and **I don't lose**. You don't have to learn everything that's covered in this guide, or everything covered in the [incredible roadmap found here](https://roadmap.sh/devops). However, even a little bit of additional training goes a long way!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JasonRodriguez1474/DevOpsHomeLab/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
